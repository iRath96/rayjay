# Rayjay

Rayjay (`Raymond JSON` scene format) provides all scene description related data-structures for the `raymond` renderer.
Most notably, this includes descriptions of shapes, materials, lights, camera and render settings of a scene.
Rayjay also implements loading and storing scene descriptions in JSON format.

Since `raymond` is a (mostly) Cycles-compliant renderer, most of the data-structures in Rayjay are heavily reminiscent of Blender's
own scene description.
